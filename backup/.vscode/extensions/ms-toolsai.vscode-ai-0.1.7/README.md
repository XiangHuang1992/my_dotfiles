## NVIDIA GPU driver, CUDA and cuDNN

### NVIDIA GPU driver

Deep learning frameworks take advantage of NVIDIA GPU to let machines learn at a speed, accuracy, and scale towards true artificial intelligence. If your computer has NVIDIA GPU cards, please visit [here](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or try OS update to install the latest driver.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Recent Mac computers don't have built-in NVIDIA GPU.

### CUDA

[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by NVIDIA. It enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the GPU. CUDA Toolkit 8.0 is required by deep learning frameworks. 

To install CUDA

- Visit this [site](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-80-ga2-download-archive), download CUDA and install it.
- Make sure to install the CUDA runtime libraries, and then add CUDA binary path to the %PATH% or $Path environment variable.
- On Windows, this path is "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\bin" by default.

![install CUDA on Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/vscode-tools-for-ai/master/media/install_cuda_win.png)

### cuDNN

[cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks by NVIDIA. cuDNN v6 is required by latest deep learning frameworks.

To install cuDNN
- Visit [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download) to download and install
- Ensure to add the directory containing cuDNN binary to the %PATH% or $Path environment variable.
- On Windows, you can copy cudnn64_6.dll to "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\bin".

> [!NOTE]
>
> Previous deep learning frameworks such as CNTK 2.0 and TensorFlow 1.2.1 need cuDNN v5.1.
> However, you can install multiple cuDNN versions together.


## Python

Python has been the primary programming language for deep learning applications. 64-bit Python distribution is required, and [Python 3.5.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-354/) is recommended for the best compatibility.

### To install Python on Windows
- We suggest to install the Python launcher for yourself only, and add Python to the %PATH% environment variable.
- Please ensure to install pip which is the package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.

Deep Learning frameworks rely on pip for their own installation.

![install Python on Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/vscode-tools-for-ai/master/media/install_python_win.png)

Then, we need to verify whether Python 3.5 is installed correctly, and upgrade pip to the latest version by executing the following commands in a terminal:

- **Windows**
    ```cmd
    C:\Users\test>python -V
    Python 3.5.4

    C:\Users\test>pip3.5 -V
    pip 9.0.1 from c:\users\test\appdata\local\programs\python\python35\lib\site-packages (python 3.5)

    C:\Users\test>python -m pip install -U pip
    ```

- **macOS**
    ```bash
    MyMac:~ test$ python3.5 -V
    Python 3.5.4

    MyMac:~ test$ pip3.5 -V
    pip 9.0.1 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)

    MyMac:~ test$ python3.5 -m pip install -U pip
    ```

## Python on Visual Studio Code

Python is fully supported in Visual Studio Code through extensions.
Please visit [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) for more details.

## NumPy and SciPy

- **NumPy** is a general-purpose array-processing package designed to efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional arrays.

- **SciPy** (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering, depending on NumPy.

Because SciPy has no official prebuilt wheel package on Windows, you need to install both NumPy and SciPy from a third party [site](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/).
First, download [numpy+mkl](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy) 1.13.1 and [scipy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy) 0.19.1 for Python 3.5 to a local directory.

Then, go to that directory and run the following commands in a terminal:
```cmd
pip3.5 install numpy-1.13.1+mkl-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl

pip3.5 install scipy-0.19.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
```

Non-Windows users don't need to install NumPy and SciPy manually.
They will be automatically installed with deep learning frameworks.

## Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)
